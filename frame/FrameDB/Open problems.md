**PROBLEM**(Expanded node indexing):
A. Each node needs to be referenceable by any other node.
B. There are at least as many nodes as Natural numbers (probably more than Real numbers).
C. It is impossible to enumerate all of those with any set of finite numbers.
Therefore:
D. It is impossible to have all nodes present in memory at the same time.
E. It is impossible to have static reference to them by a natural number or hash.
