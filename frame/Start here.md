## Core principles:

**The Goal:**
The highest value of the project is **Truth**.

**The Problems:**
However, humanity cannot even agree what **Truth** is, let alone to find it. So the best we can do is to approximate it. On top of that, as we are limited by time, limited perception, and complexity we can comprehend, we need to should focus on the most valuable parts (it is even hard to estimate what is valuable). And we also need to acknowledge that we may have different motives, biases, and perceptions.

**The solution:**
- look not only for answers but also look for why they are True
- create structure around debate to manage the complexity
- be open to any information and inputs that come
- don't simply stick to or believe in what you know
- find as many different perspectives as possible
- create models and test them rigorously
- try to prove and disprove everything 
- simplify but do not oversimplify
- focus on the specifics
- point out flaws
- explain

## Code of conduct:

> I don't think being nice to each other is useful, just don't be unnecessarily rude.
> Feelings are real, useful and Yours, but they are not an oracle.
> Focus on the job and the facts.

## Project governance:

Currently, the project is in early development phase. This means that it is small and will rapidly evolve. Thus, it is optimal to have a centralized control over it.

This control is maintained by the project's creator *Marek (Niurop) Zielina*.

Once the project has a set foundation and direction, the project will be controlled by a group of 4–10 people.

Once it is big enough to attract sponsors, a set of rules will be written and the project will be controlled by a foundation.

The exact way of making decisions, what constitutes good enough foundation and direction, as well as many others will need to be discussed. Nonetheless, decisions made will need to be reasonable and transparent.

## Financing:

Even though this is a non-profit project, there will be a cost for running the websites, development, potential legal cases and advice, potentially rewording contributors, hiring full time contributors, and potential events such as conferences. We do not plan on paying for PR and Marketing if not strictly necessary.

Everything in this project will be available free of charge, however there may be additional paid services, such as premium technical support for *FrameOS* or organization/hosting of public debates/tournaments.

We hope to provide enough value to find individual, corporate and potentially even national sponsors. Being a sponsor warrants no right to impact the project other than support and showing as a supporter.

All financial reports will be publicly available (there are non yet).
